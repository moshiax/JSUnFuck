# JSUnFuck

JSFuck decoder that extracts the original JavaScript source code by executing (not really)
JSFuck in a **controlled runtime environment** and intercepting its internal
execution paths.

---

## How it works

JSFuck executes the generated payload using one of two mechanisms:

1. **`eval`**
   - Used when **Eval Source** and **Run In Parent Scope** are enabled
   - Payload is executed via `eval(code)`

2. **`Array.prototype.at.constructor`**
   - Used when **Run In Parent Scope** is unchecked
   - Resolved indirectly via:
     ```js
     [][ "at" ][ "constructor" ](payload)()
     ```
   - This bypasses simple hooks on `eval` and global `Function`

JSUnFuck intercepts both execution paths:

- `eval` is temporarily replaced to capture the code passed to it
- `Array.prototype.at.constructor` is temporarily replaced to intercept
  indirect function constructor calls

Instead of executing the payload, the tool extracts the generated JavaScript
source and prints it to the output.

If no execution path is triggered, the input is treated as a **pure JSFuck
expression** and evaluated as a value.

## Known issues

### Symbol "F" decoding

The JSFuck mapping for the symbol **F**:

'F': '(+[]+Function)[10]'

does not reliably decode to the literal character `F` and enters eval as "(" (see tests)

## Security

**This tool is conditionally safe.**

### Safe
- When the input is **pure JSFuck** generated by a https://jsfuck.com
- The tool intercepts execution before any meaningful code runs

### Unsafe
- If arbitrary JavaScript code is inserted instead of real JSFuck
- In that case, the code may execute before interception
